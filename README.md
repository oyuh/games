## Games

### Imposter

A social deduction game where players give clues to a secret word. One or more players are imposters who don't know the word and must blend in. After clues are given, players vote to find the imposter(s).

**Key Mechanics:**
- Host selects category and starts the game.
- Each round, players submit clues in turn.
- After all clues, players vote on who they think is the imposter.
- If all imposters are found, non-imposters win; otherwise, imposters win.

### Password

A team-based word guessing game. Teams of two compete to guess secret words based on one-word clues.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Players join and are assigned to teams of two.
- Each round, teams select a category and a word.
- One player gives a one-word clue, the other guesses.
- Teams score points for correct guesses; first to reach the target wins.
